Doing things with data for money. Also for fun, but mostly for money.

### Some messy facts which I usually use for an interview introduction. 

* Studied physics, did PhD for 5 years, didn't get to thesis defence due to move to another country
* Was a full-stack developer when it was called a webmaster and jQuery was competing with prototype.js. Abandoned front-end development during the raise of AngularJS.
* Had long relationships with Microsoft Sql Server for several years during 2005-2008 SP2 eras.
* Switched to PostgreSQL after it. Still no regrets :)
* MongoDB is also fun, helped me multiple times.
* And yeah, I love SQL.
* Also did some meetup talk about CAP and PACELC theorems.
* Did C# for money, moved to Scala and Python world. Some things feel clumsy, some things feel really good here.
* Mixed feelings about Spark, especially after working with it for some decent amount of time. It can be a powerful beast, but in 90% of cases it's an overkill.
* Not an ML expert, but can build you a model and discuss a pac learning framework over a beer.
* Couldn't resist the deep learning hype, currently jumping between deep reinforcement learning and natural language processing topics.
* Big fan of ansible, vim and tmux. Cautiously toying with terraform.
* For a better description jump [here](/cv/).
