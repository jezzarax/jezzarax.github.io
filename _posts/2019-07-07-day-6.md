title: Day 6 of the experiment

Some relaxing weekends with manual morning runs of the production pipeline. Also she sneaked on to my laptop and pushed to master:

## Evening stand-up part

### What did I do today?

* Ran the `final` version of the production pipeline and made some fixes on the go so some data became a bit less corrupted. Tomorrow we'll push for some cron job on our kubernetes cluster.
* Mostly finished the paperwork I mentioned recently. Only some parts where I'm totally blocked and depend on other people are left, let's see if I manage to resolve it tomorrow.
* Wrote some code to confirm that recurrent neural networks are capable of some algorithmic calculation, in my case - reverting a sequence. [Here](https://github.com/jezzarax/seq2seq_playground/blob/master/00-seq-reversal.ipynb) goes the code. The approach was mentioned in a seq2seq paper without too many details, so the implementation is pretty random and naive.

### What do I plan to do tomorrow?

* Schedule the pipeline so I don't have to run it every morning.
* Work on code improvements I put in the beginning of the sequence reversal notebook.

### Also for upcoming days:

* As my friend suggested, try other basic "interview-level" problems, like counting the number of unique characters in a sequence.
* Implement the encoder-decoder code for machine translation based on the notebook mentioned above.
* Shift to dvc-based experimentation

### What blocks me from doing what was planned?

My cat is still laying on my left arm, hard to type atm.
