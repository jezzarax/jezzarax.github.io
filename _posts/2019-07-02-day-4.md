## Evening stand-up part

### What did I do today?

Not much progress, was jumping around the ML model to make it work before the release into an experiment in the live environment. Lots of luigi&pandas spaghetti code. CSV as a format is a silent murderer, you can never be sure what will the next piece of csv data bring, broken type inference, shifted column or improperly escaped text with double quotes.
The worst part of any data science model is that testing helps only in lab conditions, as you start pushing live data, everything goes south exactly like today. 12 hours of intensive reading of logs and incremental fixing of things and data leakage went from 45% down to 2%. Will leave it for tomorrow.

Did some more digging through vanilla seq2seq paper on a train, but nothing specific there.

### What do I plan to do tomorrow?

Copypasting yesterday's points:
* Finish the seq2seq paper reading,
* Scrap my own code where I tried to reproduce it and get it to some final point which gives numbers. That'll be just another piece of seq2seq code on the internet, nothing special there :)

Also, get rid of data leaks in the model code and track the consistency of the pipeline in general, better document it if time permits.

### What blocks me from doing what was planned?

Nothing much here.
