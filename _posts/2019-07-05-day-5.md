title: Day 5 of the experiment
---

Three days collapsed into one, nothing except continuous tracing through several hundreds of lines of pandas code. I like pandas, but it requires lots of discipline, assertions along with one's code, and, preferrably, automated testing, which, in case of data pipelines, quickly becomes messy and complicated.

## Evening stand-up part

### What did I do today?

Finalized the code, merged it with team members, things are ready to be rolled out into live environment which happens tomorrow. We don't deploy on Friday, we do it on Saturdays :P

### What do I plan to do tomorrow?

Deploy the data pipeline results at 8am in the morning :)

Still same old points mostly as there was no time to progress on these.
* Finish the seq2seq paper reading,
* Scrap my own code where I tried to reproduce it and get it to some final point which gives numbers. That'll be just another piece of seq2seq code on the internet, nothing special there :)
* Finish some urgent and annoying paperwork

### What blocks me from doing what was planned?

Nothing much here.
