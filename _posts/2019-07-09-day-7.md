title: Day 7 of the experiment
---

Chilly beginning of the week. I got reminded how unpredictable and unreliable might CSV format be. 
Some scientific papers require very deep attention to every word, some do not. Seems pretty obvious, but I'm still not very good separating ones from the others.

## Evening stand-up part

### What did I do today?

* Worked on code quality improvement of the model. After it went live for the experiment no functionality changes are allowed, still the code has to be brought into better shape before the next active phase of development starts.
* Toyed with the sequence reversal model, generally checked that it can learn even on a small number of samples and longer sequences to prove to myself that the previous results are not caused by subtle overfitting.


### What do I plan to do tomorrow?

* Prepare some monitoring dashboard for the experiment. I want to try a combination of luigi+redis+dash for that.
* Finish toying with the reversal model and plug my draft machine translation notebook into the code of it so some vanilla seq2seq machine translation forms out of it.
* Right, DVC.


### What blocks me from doing what was planned?

My desire to produce ideal code has to be taken under control again.
