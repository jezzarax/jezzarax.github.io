## First post goes here.

It's a natural thing to put `hello world` here, isn't it?

## Why is it here?

Too many things I stumble upon and want to remember, reiterate upon and potentially share. Just another experiment, let's see if it works. Will push it for 21 day, then will either drop or make it more consistent and professional.

Maybe I try experimenting in agile way. With dailies and retrospectives.

Ok, here goes a very late daily standup part:

### What did I do today?

* Some updates on a luigi-based ML data pipeline. Mostly improved the data preparation procedure and validated it against gut-feeling expectations and common sense numbers.
* Some reading on NLP applications in deep reinforcement learning, not much outcomes yet.
* Reading through a chat history of `Computational Sciences` chat server I stumbled upon recently.
* Had discussions about how should technical teams promote the business value they deliver to the business so they have enough trust to raise the awareness of their needs for handling the technical debt, improving the architecture and learning new things.

### What do I plan to do tomorrow?

Ok, nothing specific for tomorrow, travelling to meet a friend and listen to a concert in Cologne.

Still, need to finish the damn bloody tax declaration :)

Also bring the paper reading backlog into order and *maybe* publish it somewhere around here as well.

Formulate and try a code kata on `fairseq` experimentation process.

Help some friend with his struggles with pandas code.

### What blocks me from doing what was planned?

Nothing out of ordinary
