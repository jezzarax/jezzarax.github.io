## Summary

Expert Data Scientist with 16 years of experience in diverse digital environments in Germany and Russia. I've leveraged my deep understanding of data science, machine learning, and data engineering to solve complex problems and drive efficiency. My proactive and structured approach has led to notable successes, including leading teams of up to 7 members, and consistently delivering high-quality results. I'm well-versed in managing the full process of data modeling, from requirement collection to model deployment. I excel at communicating with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, often using agile methodologies. My goal is to tackle the challenge of developing and delivering innovative data analytics and language-driven decision assistance solutions.


## Job history

__Allianz SE__, 

`2021 - present`

*Language model engineer*

I play a crucial role in enabling insurance-specific products and product features by utilizing advanced language models and multimodal models. My responsibilities include:

* Fine-tuning models for specific domains: I've refined and fine-tuned language models to adapt to a particular area of knowledge and vocabulary, noticeably improving their performance and relevance.
* Model integration and optimization: I've optimized language models for internal k8s-based serving, streamlining the integration process with various products and services. 4 applications went live to be actively used by stakeholders, more are in development.
* I've improved prompting for document Q&A specific applications to improve the quality of model responses.
* Code Optimization: I've taken the initiative to refine the code for T5 models, particularly by enhancing encoder output caching and supporting larger context lengths. This has resulted in significant improvements in processing efficiency and model performance.

`2020 - 2021`

*Senior Data Scientist*

Growing team technical excellence and data-driven innovation for multiple insurance-oriented projects in complex a cross-branch environment.

* Gradually introduced a number of technologies and development approaches to enable team's process and product scalability. That resulted in smaller development iterations and more reliable delivery of products.
* Drove smooth migration of data products from an on-premise infrastructure into the cloud while keeping the services uninterrupted.
* Developed an MLOps application framework which increased the team velocity by streamligning backlog.


__Flixbus__, Munich

`2017 - 2020`

*Senior data scientist/Product owner*

As the leader of a 6-person Data Science team, I've been instrumental in driving our Marketing Automation domain. I've been responsible for:

* Product Development Leadership: I successfully led the full cycle of data-enabled adtech product development, from ideation and vision creation to deployment and ongoing improvements. I've facilitated effective communication between our team and stakeholders while managing quality and ensuring efficient time-to-market during decision-making and prioritization processes.
* AI-Driven Solutions: I excelled in delivering an AI-driven sponsored customer acquisition solution, transforming our business unit from a reactive operation into a strategy and numbers-driven entity. This contributed to a 15% improvement in ROI.
* Framework Implementation: I introduced a systematic framework for structuring and prioritizing data-driven and AI-driven products, enhancing the efficiency of our product development process.
* KPIs and Metrics: I played a significant role in defining KPIs and metrics for relevant stakeholders, ensuring these metrics are timed, observable, incremental, and relevant.
* Team Building: I actively participated in the hiring process and the definition and implementation of the product team setup, contributing to a well-structured and efficient team.
* Knowledge Sharing: I've been a speaker for internal and external talks and workshops, raising both technical and domain awareness within the company.
